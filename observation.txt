## Problem Definition

Depot
Each customer has a demand
All vehicles have a capcity
there is a distance between nodes

Goal:
the route starts at the depot and ends at the depot
the customer is visited extacly once
demand on each route must be less than vehicle capacity
total distance is minimized

## State

Time T and State S:
- Current vehicle position: p
- Remaining vehicle capacity: c
- Set of Unvisited customers: U

S = (p,cp,U)

## Action

choose action a which is:
1. Go to a customer j in a set of univisted customers.
2. Return to a depot if no more customer can be served.

## Transition

Two type of transitions:
- Go to a customer:
    - New position for customer: position+1 = j
    - Remaining capacity: c+1 = capacity -demand
    - Updated unvisited customer: Remove customer j from set of unvisited customers.
  St+1 = (j,capacity -demand,Remove customer j from set of unvisited customers.)

- Return to the depot:
    - New position: p+1 = 0
    - Refill capacity: c+1 = Q(vehicle reloaded)
    - Unvisited customers remain the same: U+1 = U
  St+1 = (0,Q,U)

## Cost

Inmediate cost: Ct
Total Cost: Sum of all distances.

# Value Function

# Policy 

choose the action that minimize the total(inmediate+future) cost
